So the recipe is: 
First you will have to add the dry ingredients into a mug or a cup or first make the batter in a bowl and then add it into a mug or a cup, it is your choice but make sure to use a microvable mug because we have to microvave the cake. And mix them all together. After doing that add the other wet ingredients into the mixture of dry ingredients and mix all of them into a nice cake batter. Then put your mug with the batter into the microvave and microvave the cake for 1 minute and then, you are done with your cake. Now its optional but you can add your topping on your cake or you dont want any topping you can leave ot alone and enjoy your cake.
